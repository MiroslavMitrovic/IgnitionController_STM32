IgnitionControllerRequirements

1. Ignition controller is able to detect the input pins for 2 cylinders.
2. Ignition controller is able to set corresponding output signal with fixed dwell time for ignition coil.
3. Ignition controller is able to change the ignition advance angle based on RPMs.
4. Ignition angle advance vs RPM table shall have at least 10 entries. 
5. If the values of ignition angle advance are between the values in table, chosen value shall be nearest to the current RPM value.
6. Ignition controller must be capable of working reliably at 9000RPM.
7. Ignition controller shall calculate the Ignition Advance angles and RPMs based on inputs from Camshaft sensors.
